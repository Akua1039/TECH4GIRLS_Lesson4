        <p>The English Legal System <br>Laws are developed through many means to 
            provide a structured legal framework within a community. The major approach is 
            through statutes, which are laws passed by a legislative body such as Parliament. 
            England practices a Bicameral system of government, meaning it has two different 
            parliaments. It consists of the House of Commons and House of Lords. 
            In the United Kingdom, legislation is generally implemented through statutes, 
            which are created by the Parliament.
